Vine Group has certainly capitalized on Toronto\u2019s explosive growth, even securing financing for small and mid-sized real estate developers. But commercial brokers don\u2019t necessarily have to think that big to take advantage of the fervent demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA lot of lenders on the residential side have door policies,\u201d Hugo Dos Reis, a partner at Vine Group, said of limits placed on residential&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.yourinvestmentpropertymag.com.au\/calculators\/\">investment properties<\/a>. \u201cLenders don\u2019t want to loan to holding companies, and if they do they charge a premium. Even the big banks are getting away from that as well, but what we\u2019ve found is that a lot of people are looking at multi-residential commercial properties instead of buying, say, a triplex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe lending now is on the asset and the most important part of the deal: the cash flow. The client\u2019s exposure in other properties is an advantage because we can articulate in our business case that we have an experienced real estate investor who\u2019s invested in small to mid-sized commercial properties. As regulation gets tighter on the residential side\u2014because residential financing isn\u2019t designed for large portfolios\u2014the banks are still lending, only it\u2019s on the commercial side.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chartered banks aren\u2019t the only lenders partial to lending on commercial properties; alternative and private lenders, too, are capitalizing on voracious appetite for commercial assets. According to Liam Sauro, associate vice president of Capital Markets Group, B-20 is to thank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the short-term, the private lending market on both residential and commercial is growing as a result because people require more equity, or leverage, than a bank is willing to offer them, and that\u2019s led to growth in institutional Tier 2 lending,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also led to tertiary lender growth, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s slowing down any time soon, especially so long as those rules are in place.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In juxtaposing Canadian and American banking mentalities, Sauro believes strict residential lending criteri will persist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThose rules are part of what make up the whole mentality of the banking system here. In the U.S., they have a growth period and they look to loose regulation; in Canada, you have a period of can be perceived to be unsustainable growth and they look to tighten regulation because of fear of what could happen next.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mortgagebrokernews.ca\/news\/commercial-mortgage\/osfi-regulation-benefits-commercial-sector-255930.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Source: Mortgage Broker News<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Neil Sharma With no sign of residential lending restrictions loosening any time soon, demand for commercial real estate has become white-hot. \u201cOn the commercial front, we\u2019re seeing a lot more activity on buildings of more than 5 units,\u201d said David Goncalves, a mortgage broker and partner of&nbsp;Mortgage Alliance&nbsp;Vine Group. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing this upswing because [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":62,"featured_media":1553,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-site-content-layout":"","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"default","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"default","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"default","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"ast-content-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.7 -
